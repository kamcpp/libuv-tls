# libuv-tls
Add SSL/TLS functionality on top of libuv using OpenSSL.

This small library adds SSL/TLS functionality using BIO pair on libuv. It tries to provide
API similar to libuv with bare minimum change. Also it tries to use facilities provided by
OpenSSL. Currently it scratches BIO pair only as a result. This might go away as we learn
more and more both on OpenSSL and libuv. Writing our own custom BIO will lend lot more
flexibility. 

We intend to provide the library as subpart of libuv, if we can finish soon.

### TODO:
- Add session resumption feature - may be later version
- Renegotiation not yet handled - may be later version
- Work on supporting DTLS support - later versions
- Work on building and packaging

### Usage and API
libuv-tls have similar looking API as that of libuv. Any libuv users can easily used the API 
looking at the `uv_tls.h`.

uv_tls.h have all the APIs and users including this header will still have access to all APIs
being exported by uv.h

As of now, libuv-tls does not hide any symbols.

Sample usage can be seen at ```test_tls.c``` and ```test_tls_client.c```

### CONTRIBUTING
Clone/fork the library and play around and provide feedback/patches or anything for improvement.
